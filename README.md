# Cat & Dog Breed Classifier AI Model

This repository contains AI models to classify cat and dog breeds, as well as a model to identify whether an image contains a cat or a dog. It includes training and prediction notebooks along with pre-trained models.

## Overview

This project provides:

1. **Breed Classification Models** – Separate models for cats and dogs that predict the breed from a given image.  
2. **Binary Classification Model** – A model that identifies whether a given image is of a cat or a dog.  

The project is implemented using deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
